# Docs Chat V2

This is the source code for docs chat v2. This is an online chat that mimics the look of a google document.

## Features
- Realtime messaging
- active user display
- joining different channels
- private messaging

## How to use

This is just the source code. You'll have to download and run `npm install`. You also need to plug in the firebaseConfig in `main.js`, and ensure the realtime database is set up in your project.

You may need a `V2/` object in your realtime database, idk tho
